# National Voter File Newbie Onboarding Branch

The goal of this branch is to present the National Voter File scripts in a structured and well-documented way so that new contributors can easily get up to speed.
The documentation and organization of this branch should be such that someone with only basic knowledge of Python and MySQL can set up a local version of the database, populated with as much data as is easily accessible.

Since this guide will explain how to recreate the database *de novo*, writing it should have the desirable side-effect of preparing our scripts for regular updates to the main database.
